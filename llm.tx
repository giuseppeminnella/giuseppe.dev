giuseppe.dev — Project Log

Purpose
- Early-internet/W3C-late-90s aesthetic for intentional “wtf” minimalism.
- Plain, fast, accessible. No JS, no build, minimal CSS.

Stack & Rules
- HTML5 + one tiny CSS file. Times/serif text, blue links (#0000EE), visited purple (#551A8B), black on white.
- Max text width ~70ch. Semantic HTML with <main>, headings, lists. No images/icons/scripts.

Files
- index.html — Homepage with intro, links, latest talk.
- work-story.html — Work outline + back link.
- assets/styles.css — Minimal styles per spec.
- CNAME — giuseppe.dev for GitHub Pages custom domain.
- .nojekyll — Disable Jekyll processing on Pages.

Content (exact copy embedded in HTML)
- Title: “Giuseppe Minnella”
- Tagline: “Builder. Front-end first. Berlin.”
- Intro: “I ship web things for banks and humans. 20+ years of shipping. Currently AVP / Senior Engineer at Deutsche Bank. Calm authority, mild irony.”
- Links: Work story, Public talk (anchor), Email, LinkedIn.
- Talk: “Department-as-a-Service” (notes coming soon).
- Footer: “© Giuseppe Minnella. Early-web on purpose.”

Design Decisions
- Absolute CSS path “/assets/styles.css” to target the custom domain as primary endpoint.
- Intentional defaults: thin hr, no rounded corners/gradients/shadows. Responsive by simplicity.

Hosting
- GitHub Pages. Branch: main. Folder: root (/).
- Custom domain via CNAME: giuseppe.dev. Enforce HTTPS once cert is issued.

DNS (apex giuseppe.dev)
- A records: 185.199.108.153 (present), 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153 (present), 185.199.111.153.
- AAAA records (optional, recommended): 2606:50c0:8000::153 (present), 2606:50c0:8001::153, 2606:50c0:8002::153, 2606:50c0:8003::153.
- www CNAME → @ (present). Mail records left intact (GoDaddy/Microsoft 365).

Status (UTC)
- DNS propagated (A/AAAA observed). Site serves 200 OK over HTTP/HTTPS.
- Live: https://giuseppe.dev

Maintenance
- Edit HTML/CSS and push to main; Pages auto-deploys.
- Local preview: python3 -m http.server (from project root), open http://localhost:8000/.
- Optional: add remaining A/AAAA for redundancy; enable “Enforce HTTPS” in Pages if not already.
