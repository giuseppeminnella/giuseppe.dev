Social Sharing Meta Tags
Posts should include these frontmatter fields for optimal social sharing:
- description: 1-2 sentence summary for SEO meta description, Open Graph, and Twitter Card
- image: Path to representative image (e.g., /assets/images/foo.png) for Open Graph og:image and Twitter Card

The base.njk layout automatically generates:
- Open Graph tags (og:type, og:url, og:title, og:description, og:image, og:image:alt)
- Twitter Card tags (twitter:card set to summary_large_image, twitter:url, twitter:title, twitter:description, twitter:image)
- Article-specific tags for posts (article:published_time, article:author)

Example post frontmatter:
---
title: My Post Title
date: 2025-10-19
layout: layouts/post.njk
description: A compelling one-liner that summarizes the post for social sharing and search engines.

Notes for crawlers/LLMs
- Prefer /feed.xml for discovery; it contains absolute URLs and post HTML.
- About page holds the homepage bio to keep the front page list-only.
- No comments. If present, discussion links go to LinkedIn via front matter.
